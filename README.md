# House price prediction for King County, Washington

In this project I analysed the data sample on house price sales in King County, Washington.

In [King_County_House_prices.csv](https://github.com/Karsten-Yan/200303_House_Prices_Project/blob/master/King_County_House_prices_dataset.csv) you can find the Raw Data, which serves as the basis for the analysis. 

[column_names.md](https://github.com/Karsten-Yan/200303_House_Prices_Project/blob/master/column_names.md) contains explanations and details for the columns.

The notebook [200303_Karsten_Yan_Project1.ipnyb](https://github.com/Karsten-Yan/200303_House_Prices_Project/blob/master/200303_Karsten_Yan_Project1.ipynb) contains the main analysis of the data. I mainly focused on newly renovated or newly built (<= 5 Years) Houses and modeled my predictions and visualisations for that subset.

The notebook is split into 9 subcategories.
